<p> My name is Eva and I go to STEM Early College Highschool. I graduate June 2018 and I plan to go to a university in the Fall of 2018. 
I enjoy spending time with my three dogs, I also have one cat. I'am the youngest of all my siblings, I have a very big family we are all so close.
Hot Cheetos are my favorite snacks, hot puffs, hot fries, etc.. Honeslty I'am not to sure what I want to majorn in, I'm torn between politicial science and something  </p>
